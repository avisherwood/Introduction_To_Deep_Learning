# Introduction to deep learning
Introduction to Deep Learning, basic theory and full coding examples.
### Part 1 - Linear perceptron and the concept ofÂ learning
Discussion is on the structure of a neuron and the algorithmical concept concept behind learning.
The coded example single linear neuron or perceptron, learning the logic OR and AND Gates.
* Inspiration - The Biological Neuron Model
* Perceptron - An Artificial Neural Network
* Decision Units - Activation functions
* Learning - the Bias and weights
* Perceptron Example - Logic OR
### Part 2 - Non Linear Perceptron
How to extend learning,with deep networks and non linear activation functions.
* Why deep learning ?
* Non Linear Activation function
* Handwritten Digit Classification (Mnist )
### Part 3 - Multiple Layer Neural Networks
Delta rule for learning, Gradient Descent and backpropagation
* How to train Multiple Layer Neural Networks
* Gradient Decent - Minimize loss function iteratively
* Delta rule for learning
* Backpropagation
* Train and predict MLP for Logic OR - example
### Part 4 - Keras Mnist example
Build and visualize Simple feed forward dense network with Mnist data
* Load and normalize data set
* Create the model
* Train the model
* Evaluate Model
* Predict
### Part 5 - Convolution Neural Network
What is convolution network ?
* Intuition and examples
* Basic terms and building blocks of CNN
* Keras CNN to classify Mnist data
